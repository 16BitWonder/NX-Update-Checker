# NX-Update-Checker
A small console application that checks a Switch's installed contents against a provided versionlist for newer updates, and then writes the titles with newer updates and the latest version to sdmc:/Available-Updates.txt.

## Usage
- Grab the latest versionlist.json available from the [ReSwitched Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZdqEhed)'s #versionlist-updates channel, and save it as "versionlist.json" in the same directory as NX-Update-Checker.nro
- Run the nro with your favorite variation of the HBMenu
- Watch the pretty text move across the screen
- Profit(?)


## Notice
This app was specifically written to parse the versionlists posted in the ReSwitched Discord Server, if you provide a versionlist.json with even a slightly different format it is likely this application will not parse it correctly.

## Kudos
Big thanks to the folks over at the Reswitched Discord that have set up the versionlist bot.
Without a nice stream of updated versionlists this wouldn't be feasible.
